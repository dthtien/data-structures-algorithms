# Data Structures
## Array

### Definition
  - Array is contigous area of memory consisting of equal size elements indexed by contiguous integers

### Constant time access
```ruby
array_addr + element_size ( i - first_index )
```
### Times for common operations
||Add|Remove|
|-|-|-|
|Beginning|O(n)| O(n)|
|End|O(1)|O(1)|
|Middle|O(n)|O(n)|

#### Note:
-  Arrays are greate if you want add or remove at the end but expensive if you want to add ore remove in the middle or
   at the beginning
- We have this constant time access to elements, either read or write
